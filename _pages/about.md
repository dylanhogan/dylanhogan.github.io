I am a PhD student in Sustainable Development at Columbia University SIPA. I'm broadly interested in issues related to climate change and economic development, with particular interest in the role of adaptation mechanisms in reducing impacts to humans and ecosystems. Most recently, I'm interested in  topics related to agriculture and water availability.

Prior to starting my PhD, I worked for the Climate Impact Lab, an interdisciplinary team at University of Chicago estimating the social impacts of climate change, where I contributed to analyses of mortality, agricultural yield, and labor productivity. I received my undergraduate degree in Applied Mathematics and Economics from Brown University.

Please see a summary of my research below, and feel free to contact me to discuss my work.
